2. Internal Mutli-Cloud Inventory
  Created an internal website for cloud inventory management across AWS and Azure, providing real-time infrastructure insights accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
  With further PowerAutomate we can added real-time inventory fetching feature and downloading customized inventoryy based on various filters/tags.

  - **Allow app teams to see and fetech current Inventory without devop team involvement**
